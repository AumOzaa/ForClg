/* Notes: 

TO run the nested class say A has a nested class B then 
in then in the console if you want to run class B then enter this:
 "A$B"

statement in cmd: javac fileName.java then
java OuterClassName$InnerClassName
 
Creating object of inner class:

A.B var = new A.B();
it'll be valid only if the B class(inner-Class) is Static
